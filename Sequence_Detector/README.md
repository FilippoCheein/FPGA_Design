In this experiment, we design an FSM sequence detector that will detect a sequence based on the button pressed information and a preset input sequence using switches.

circuit uses first 8 switches to input random 1’s and 0’s to a string of numbers. This string is fed into a sequence detector and analyzed to check if one of two pre-set sequences can be found in the string. “Cool” message is shown if sequence is found, and “Crud” if one isn’t found.
