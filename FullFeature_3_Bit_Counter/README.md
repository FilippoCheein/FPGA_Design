In this project, we designed an FSM that implements a synchronous 3-bit up/down counter that consider the number from 0 to 7. 
Based on the button and the switches that are pressed it counts in different ways. 
UP is to say if the count should be up or down. 
EVEN is to show only the EVEN numbers while ODD is to show only the odd numbers. 
HOLD keep the same number in the display while reset clears the counter.
